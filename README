Chinchilla is a project we built for our COMP0112 (Networking) course this semeseter (spring 2015). The idea behind the project
was to test out different load balancing algorithms and visualize them in a meaningful way. We decided to use go to build
the scheduler-worker infrastructure, and then built our testing server in go as well. The front end, which allows us to 
visualize the different scheduling algorithms at work, was built using d3. Though we didn't have much time to put intense 
testing and error handling in place, it's a fun project that we really enjoyed building. If you'd like to run the front end
interface on your local machine, follow the steps below:

Building the executables:
go build src/chinchilla/routers/scheduler.go
go build src/chinchilla/routers/worker.go
go build src/chinchilla/routers/webserver.go
